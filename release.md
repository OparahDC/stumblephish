## Initial Release

There has been a lot of talk today about America first, and a dark world view of tombstones and walls.  As citizens of the world we make a counter argument that by building tools for all of humanity, and supporting the growth of global knowledge, we make the world a better place.

Main Line Health (https://www.mainlinehealth.org/), is a not-for-profit healthcare organization with nearly half a dozen hospitals serving the Philadelphia region.  The Enterprise Security Team devotes their efforts to ensuring the safety of patient records and IT infrastructure.  We work in a health care environment devoted to the service of our fellow citizends.

The initial release of Stumblephish is extremely pre-beta, but is deliberately being made on January 20, 2017.  In accordance with our belief that by building tools and sharing them we can make the world a better place we're making this release in the hopes that it helps assuage many of the negative sentiments of this historic day.

We plan on buildng Stumblephish into a full fledged tool for penetration testers and encourage feedback, contributions, and bug reports.  Our hope is that this tool will, in a very small way, advance the field of information security, add to our community, and assist others regardless of race, gender, creed, income level, sexual orientation, or geographic location.
